# Welcome to Scrabble Roto

Create your Scrabble Roto team for the 2025 TO Autocar Bangkok International here!

## History
The TO Autocar Bangkok International is the spiritual successor to the Brand's Crossword Game King's Cup. Until and including the 2017 edition, the King's Cup included a unique rotisserie tournament called the Team Unity Prize (unique because it was open only to players participating in the event, and you had to pick yourself). This was one of my favorite things about my favorite tournament ever, so I'm bring it back. (This roto is not organized or endorsed by the Bangkok Crossword Club.)

## How it works
- Register/login above
- Browse existing teams and create your own
- You can only create one team. **If you are playing in this event, you have to pick yourself for the rating band you belong to.**
- Deadline for creating a team - **Saturday, October 11, 2025, at 1.30PM Bangkok Time (UCT+7)**.
- Pay 500THB/SGD20/USD15 to Jeremy Khoo after creating a team. (You can pay after the deadline, just pay by Saturday.)
    - Acceptable payment methods: Cash in Bangkok (preferred), PayNow (if you have my number), Wise (@jeremyk310), and Venmo (@Jeremy-Khoo).

## Rules
- Teams will be ranked by total wins and then total spread will be used as the tiebreaker.
- During the tournament, team standings will be updated as results become available.

## Prizes

TBA. All entry fees will be returned as prizes. There will also be some sponsored prizes.
