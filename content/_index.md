# Welcome to Scrabble Roto

Create your Scrabble Roto team for the 2025 TO Autocar Bangkok International here!
(This roto is not organized or endorsed by the Bangkok Crossword Club.)

## How it works
- Register/login above
- Browse existing teams and create your own
- Deadline for creating a team - **Saturday, October 11, 2025, at 1.30PM Bangkok Time (UCT+7)**.
- Pay 500THB/SGD20/USD15 to Jeremy Khoo after creating a team. (You can pay after the deadline, just pay by Saturday.)
    - Acceptable payment methods: Cash in Bangkok (preferred), PayNow (if you have my number), Wise (@jeremyk310), and Venmo (@Jeremy-Khoo).
    - You can create multiple teams, but you need to pay the entry fee for each team you create.

## Rules
- Teams will be ranked by total wins and then total spread will be used as the tiebreaker.
- During the tournament, team standings will be updated as results become available.

## Prizes
